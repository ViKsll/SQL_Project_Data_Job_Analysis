# SQL Data Job Market Analysis Project

This project analyzes top-paying roles, in-demand skills, and where high demand meets high salary in data analytics.

Check out SQL queries here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)

### The SQL queries were designed to answer the following questions:

1. What are the highest-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these high-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand in data analytics?
4. Which skills are linked to higher salaries?
5. What skills are the best to learn for better job opportunities and pay?

# Tools I used

For this project, I used several key tools to analyze the data analyst job market:

- **SQL:** The core tool of this project. I used SQL to clean, filter, join, and analyze the data to answer specific questions about salaries and skills.
- **PostgreSQL:** The database management system where the job market dataset was stored.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** I used Git for version control and GitHub to store and share my project.

# The Analysis 

Each query in this project focused on exploring a different part of the data analyst job market. Below is how I approached each question:

## 1. Top Paying Analyst Jobs

To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.
```sql
SELECT job_id,
         job_title,
         job_location,
         job_schedule_type,
         salary_year_avg,
         job_posted_date,
         name AS company_name
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
AND job_location = 'Anywhere' 
AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **Wide Salary Range:** The top 10 highest-paying roles range from $184,000 to $650,000, showing strong earning potential in the field.

LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
AND job_location = 'Anywhere' 
AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10 
)

SELECT top_paying_jobs.*,
       skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
```
